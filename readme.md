SonicJump for SegaSaturn
---
Usage:
You will need the last version of SaturnOrbit (Thanks Rockin-B) and a clean Windows XP machine, in modern times I'have used a VM and works perfectly. Try to build the resources (sounds, sprites, backgrounds) and then compile it.

Credits:
Sega for create the game and the awesome console.
